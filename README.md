Projects for Udacity Nanodegree - Predictive Analytics for Business

# 1 Predicting Catalog Demand
In this project, I analyze a business problem in the mail-order catalog business.
1. predict how much money the company can expect to earn from sending out a catalog to new customers.
2. this task involves building the model and applying the results in order to provide a recommendation to management.

# 2 Data Cleanup
I perform an analysis to recommend the city for Pawdacityâ€™s newest store, based on predicted yearly sales.
1. blend and format data and deal with outliers.
2. use the cleaned up dataset to create another linear regression model. 
3. choose which variable(s) are the most important for the model using new techniques learned in the Selecting Predictor Variables section.

# 3 Predict Default Risk
The input data sets is an influx of loan applications in bank industry, I built and apply a classification model to provide a recommendation on which loan applicants the bank should lend to.
1. explore and clean up the business data to properly build the model and select predictor variables.
2. train my dataset with different classification models 
3. compare all of the model's performance against each other 
4. provide a report including key business decisions that should be made in a timely manner.

# 4 A/B Testing on new feature launch
I design and analyze an A/B Test for a use case where a chain of coffee shops are considering launching a new menu. I write up a recommendation on whether the chain should introduce the new menu.
1. analyze transaction data for all stores from 2015-January-21 to 2016-August-18 and select 10 stores as test markets.
2. plan analysis like performance metrics, test period, and data aggregation level.
3. data preprocess including clean-up and aggregate the transaction data to the appropriate level and filter on the appropriate data ranges
4. create the trend and seasonality variables, and use them along with you other control variable(s) to match two control units to each treatment unit
5. conduct my A/B analysis and create a short report outlining your results and recommendations.

# 5 Retail Supply-Chain data prediction
1. use Alteryx to extract 116k row data and generate the key performance metrics for cost and profit
2. apply RAND and CH to determine the numbers of groups for K-means clustering model with 95 stores, and use gradient boosting model to predict the best store format for the new stores with 0.89 of F1 score
3. build ETS and ARIMA models to understand the time series trend (linear and nonlinear components), and  predict the produce sales
4. use principal components analysis (PCA, dimensionality reduction) to reduce the number of variables and apply a k-centroid cluster model
5. build Tableau dashboards illustrating geospatial and operation insights in retailing supply chain and identifying key cost drivers in different manufacturing factory countries, categories, brands
